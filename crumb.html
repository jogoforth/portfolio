        <p>Everyone should have access to sound saving plans. The average person doesn't have access to a financial advisor, but now they will. With mobile saving plans, anyone can save for any life event.</p>
    <p>This project was part of my Career Foundry Bootcamp. I was given a basic outline to create a financial app either focused on helping a user save or invest their money. Throughout this project, I created Brand Guidelines, did Competitor Research, did several rounds of user testing, and created designs from sketches to high-fidelity wireframes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
<h2>Competitor Research</h2>
<p>To begin my work cycle I explored the current market. I analyzed six of the top savings apps to see what is currently offered to users, and what is missing that they would appreciate.

    The critical aspect missing was the ability to include stretch goals and an app offering various saving plans to help meet the user's goals in different ways.</p>

        <h2>User Journey</h2>
        <p>With the goal of crafting a robust saving app, I crafted three primary user flows to create a user journey.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my savings goal is and how long I have to reach it so that I can save accordingly.</li>
            <li>As a user, I want to be notified and rewarded when I have reached certain milestones throughout the saving period to know whether I'm on track to reach my goal.</li>
            <li>As a user, I want to receive personalized saving plans to save money to reach my goal in time.</li>    
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>After defining my main user journey I set out to create time-saving low fidelity sketches of my wireframes. I was able to quickly iterate versions of these wireframes, before choosing what worked the best and heading over to Figma.</p>
        <picture> <source srcset="img/crumb/crumb-sketch" media="(max-width:767px)"> 
            <img src="img/crumb/crumb-sketches.jpeg" alt="Paper sketch of user flow.">
    </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>Using Figma, I translated my first sketches into low-fidelity wireframes. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for some user testing. I then created a prototype of a key user flow, loading the app for the first time through creating your first project, and tested it with five potential users. Based on this testing, I made a few alternations and moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes.</p>

        <img src="img/crumb/crumb-low-mid-comparison.png" alt="Showing the detailed diference between low and mid fidelity wireframes, and the user feedback that effected them.">

</div>
<div>
<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
<p>I created a fully-functional, high-fidelity prototype of the new flows using Figma. Using the user feedback from my previous testing, I guided my designs to their new level of detail. At this phase, I again incorporated user testing with A and B testing for the color palette of the wireframes. Using the comments on the A and B testing I was able to synthesize those results to create a more welcoming and useable design.</p>
<h3>Issue One</h3>
<p>I continued to run into issues regarding contrast in my design.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>By creating a design with a darker palette and a lighter one I was able to hear from users what worked for each design, to then create a design that adhered to the Brand Guidelines while also catering to users' needs.
</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>UI Design</h2>
    <p>Once the usability issues were resolved, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. My goal was to create a visual identity that was aligned with the brandâ€™s values and message. The key aspects of the Brand Guideline I adhered to were the tenants of clarity, precision, and friendliness. The design needed to be one that is easily understood and minimalist to provide focus. Therefore each wireframe was pared down to its essential details, while still providing robust offerings.</p>

        <img src="img/crumb/crumb-desktop-mockup.png" alt="Mockup of a a computer showing the Crumb desktop homepage.">
</picture>
<p>After designing the key wireframes for the mobile app, I designed the homepage for the desktop site. When new users look up the app they need the ability to search for information about the company, its goals, and reviews of the app itself.</p>
</div>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Following these designs, the next key elements to design would be Push Notifications and Celebratory Animations. Push Notifications would be designed to encourage the user to meet their saving dates, and notify users of milestones met. Every time the user meets a milestone they will receive a celebratory push notification as well as an animation when they next open the app.</p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>This project expanded my knowledge of fintech, as well as the standards that need to be met within financial savings plans. It also tested my understanding of contrast, clarity, and visibility.

    My user testing phases were invaluable, every user had poignant feedback to offer, and it helped hone my designs at every stage.</p>
